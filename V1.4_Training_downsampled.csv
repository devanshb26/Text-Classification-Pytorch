3855,6720,The app list should be in grid style and background should be customized.,1
3856,6721,The keyborad should also be customized like the gadget comfort on-screen keyboard in windows 7 (desktop).,1
3857,6724,Please allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a Git repository and simply push to a Git remote to upload.,1

3866,6809,When Cortana has an expression that it doesn't understand based on the available expressions registered but Cortana does recognize an app name it would be great if the user's expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future.,1
3867,6818,Window should stay the size I left it.,1
3868,6831,Please add CAN API to be included in the Windows.Devices.,1

3891,6970,Perhaps more developers would build for Windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions.,1
3892,6980,This is an excellent feature but I would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal WinJS app.,1
3893,6981,It would be great to use Bower to install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies of the same script into the Windows project and the Windows Phone project.,1

3927,7274,Please include my country Yemen in pay out and advertisement too.,1
3928,7279,DatePicker should be allowed to have a null value initially and not a programmatically set that could accidentally be mistake for a user's input.,1

3953,7695,I feel that it is important to be able to minimize the CommandBar in Windows Phone apps because there is limited screenspace so even something like the CommandBar can make a difference.,1
3954,7696,I like the ability for apps to connect to the people hub and show items in the news feed but there are some things that are really annoying to consumers and could be solved with a few APIs.,1

3977,7893,A an ability to the emulator that can emulate a bad data connection so we can discover performance problems before our clients receive it.,1
3978,7896,Well I think that the devcenter app should be updated/extended so that the app can show the windows store apps as well as the phone apps (which it currently does) Ideally it should also use the live tiles to show the current stats on your apps.,1

3987,7987,I think that having and IAP price point of $0.49 could be wildly attractive to end users and get more purchases for developers.,1
3988,7989,I'd like to be able to ping for nearby devices running an app using PeerfFinder but while the app is not in the foreground.,1
3989,7991,Would it be practical to make it so that a user could authorize proximity tracking in the background so that an app could utilize it?,1

3999,8029,For one of our products we need to support NFC card reading/writing with existing devices and several types of cards (Mifare UL ULC Calypso Desfire maybe even more),1

4001,8050,Please add recent places to SuggestedStartLocation in FileOpenPicker API.,1
4002,8052,It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.,1
4003,8074,Please implement the HttpListener class so that we can run REST based controls (similar to Xbox Smartglass) for our own apps?,1
4004,8110,Let normal http:// URIs to be able to send notifications to the app using the window.external.notify and not only the https:// URIs.,1

4022,8343,I would like to have better access to Lockscreen so that I can completely customize it which includes how the time is displayed any custom content like photos or news wallpaper.,1
4023,8344,It should also allow a timer based updation.,1
4024,8349,Obviously there should probably be a PIN requirement for first use/set up trust but the NFC capabilities of the WP platform will never be fully realized until a simple tap can make something happen without user interference.,1
4025,8358,make multitasking a real thing like seeing a video or having a mini calc when browse some thing.,1
4026,8362,Live tiles are fine but we need a true way to make tiles more dynamic and that would be accomplished with a widget application template.,1
4027,8363,In a similar way to the new lock-screen apps allow developers to create an app that runs inside a tile of larger dimensions that then current pre-defined tile sizes.,1
4028,8364,The app should have full access to touch events on the tile so it can respond to them.,1

4037,8406,it is better if developers can start their app from background i mean one develops an app that has permission to start itself when it receives a notification.,1
4038,8413,I understand power consumption is a consideration but a more balanced middle ground like only allowing more intensive background tasks when the system is plugged in and/or giving users clear indications such activity is occurring (liek Android does in its notification bar) so that they know why battery life is being impacted would make the WinRT environment much more useful and in turn drive adoption.,1
4039,8426,It would be great for a permanently running app to have an API which notifies it when an update is available to notify when an update is forced to permit the app to check for an update easily and also to permit the app execute the update.,1
4040,8438,Would become even more useful if say i could share to reading list from chrome extension or mac desktop or iOs.,1
4041,8439,We need the PivotViewer control for WPF and WinRT please.,1
4042,8441,I think that a wise addition would be to create a Universal search platform that when enabled a single tap on the Search button will bring up only a search bar and with that the user would search for content inside the app (and by content I'm talking specifically for app content).,1
4043,8490,Allow XAML winRT apps to change the lock screen background.,1
4044,8492,It would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp8.1,1
4045,8504,Be responsible and give more & specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.,1
4046,8515,As with CSS it would be very useful if we could set text based framework elements to be UPPERCASE lowercase Title Case etc with a TextTransform property in Xaml.,1
4047,8532,Please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account.,1
4048,8556,The point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls.,1
4049,8562,Please allow windows phone 8.1 file/folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist.,1
4050,8563,Also please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt.,1

4055,8593,Make Bing Vision lens in the camera app pinnable to Start for quick access again and/or add it to the Cortana screen to the left of the Music Search button perhaps.,1
4056,8595,Please add the From To options right after Download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails.,1
4057,8600,The Online Media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos.,1
4058,8604,It would be good if there was more sorting (either via the photo hub or via code) which allows all items to be sorted title\creation timestamp\last updated timestamp ascending\descending.,1
4059,8606,Pleas allow in the WMappmanifest a selection box to force legacy resume mode so my WP81 app can function just as it did in WP8.,1
